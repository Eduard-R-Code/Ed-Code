# Ed - Code

This is a message encryption script. 
It will take the input text of a user and ask for a key.
The message is encrypted using other techniques very similar to the classic Caesar Cypher just to confuse anyone who the actual message is not destined for.



## Usage

The script will ask at the beginning which side of it would the user like to access: Decode or Encode.

The script will ask for an input message and a desired key, and according to the previous selection it will Encode or Decode the message.

## Future Development

Will update this script to use a double encryption and an integrated key generated by the new secret random function added in the last half of 2022 in Python.
